# mobile-ui-components-guide

The purpose of this repo is to implement mobile UI elements that users frequently use 
in mobile enviornment and commonly used in Design System based on UX principles, 
not to learn a specific language with the goal of improving programming skills. Of course, 
I will introduce the process of programming to implement components, but the key is to analyze
 what experience each component provides to the user. Therefore, through this repo, I want to share 
my insights for making good products in a mobile enviornment with others and rather than focusing only on programming, 
I want to become as 'a UX Engineer who can code with the user in mind.
